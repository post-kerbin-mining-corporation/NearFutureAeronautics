## Features

This mod features a number of new parts for spaceplanes and aircraft.

* **Large Multimode Engines:** Big (2.5m), powerful RAPIER-like engines for your wildest spaceplane needs.
* **Large Jet Engines:** Hefty 2.5m engines - turbofans and turbojets for big aircraft.
* **Advanced Propeller Engines:** Super-efficient low speed propfans and turboprops.
* **Lift Fans:** Designed specifically for efficient VTOL and available in many sizes, these engines can run on LiquidFuel and air, or be * driven electrically for flight in oxygenless atmospheres.
* **Nuclear Jet Engines:** Massive, rewarding engines that let you fly almost forever!
* **Large Nacelles and Intakes:** Of course, 2.5m nacelles, engine pods, precoolers and advanced intakes to help out.
